"""Visualize HoloPy objects

Uses Matplotlib and Mayavi to visualize holopy objects.

1. :class:`.Image`, :class:`.Volume`, or :class:`.Spheres` object =>
   plot or rendering

This module does not import plotting packages until they are actually needed so
that holopy does not have a hard dependency on mayavi or matplotlib.  Because of
this you may see a small lag on your first plot.
