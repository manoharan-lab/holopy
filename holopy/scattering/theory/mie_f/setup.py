Extensions for T-Matrix scattering calculations (in fortran77 and
fortran90); numpy.distutils should automatically use f2py to compile
these, and f2py should detect your fortran compiler.

The code works with gcc, but has not been tested with other
compilers.  Note that f2py by default compiles with optimization
flags.

Ignore compiler warnings of unused variables, unused dummy
arguments, and variables being used uninitialized from compiling
scsmfo_min. The former is relics of how scsmfo was written which I
am not touching. The latter is likely due to some GOTO statements that
could cause a variable to be referenced before it's initialized. Under
normal usage I wouldn't worry about it.
