'''Scattering calculations

The scattering package provides objects and methods to define
scatterer geometries, and theories to compute scattering from
specified geometries.  Scattering depends on holopy.core, and certain
scattering theories may require external scattering codes.

The HoloPy scattering module is used to:

1. Describe geometry as a :mod:`~holopy.scattering.scatterer` object
2. Define the result you want as a :mod:`~holopy.core.marray.Schema` object
3. Calculate scattering quantities with an
   :mod:`~holopy.scattering.theory` appropriate for your
   :mod:`~holopy.scattering.scatterer` ->
   :class:`~holopy.core.marray.Marray` object
