        A Janus (two faced) sphere

        A two layer particle with the outer layer only spanning one hemisphere. A particle
        with no rotation has its cap pointing along +z, specify other orientations by euler
        angle rotations from that reference.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : complex, complex
            Index of refraction of each layer
        r : float, float
            Outer radius of each layer
        normal : (float, float)
            Euler angles beta and gamma to rotate from the reference position
        center : (float, float, float)
            The "center" of the janus sphere. This "center" is actually the center of the full
            sphere, and is at the center of curvature of the shell, but it is not actually the
            center of mass of the whole structure.
