"""Loading, saving, and basic processing of data.

holopy.core contains code to load images and holopy yamls into
:mod:`.marray` objects. It also contains the machinery for saving
all HoloPy objects as holopy yaml files. Finally, it provides some
basic mathematical operations, mostly as higher level wrappers around
numpy or scipy routines.

Main use cases are

1. Image or other data file + metadata => :class:`.Image` or other
   :class:`.Marray` object

2. Raw :class:`.Image` + processing => processed :class:`.Image` object

3. Any :class:`.HoloPyObject` from calculations or processing => achival
   yaml text or text/binary result
