The centerfinder module is a group of functions for locating the
centers of holographic ring patterns. The module can find the center
of a single-sphere holographic pattern, a dimer holographic pattern,
or the centers of multiple (well-separated: clearly separate ring
patterns with separate centers) single spheres or dimers. The intended
use is for determining an initial parameter guess for hologram fitting.

We thank the Grier Group at NYU for suggesting the use of the Hough
transform. For their independent implementation of a Hough-based
holographic feature detection algorithm, see:

    """
    Finds the coordinates of the center of a holographic pattern.
    The coordinates returned are in pixels (row number, column
    number). Intended for finding the center of single particle or
    dimer holograms which basically show concentric circles. The
    optional threshold parameter (between 0 and 1) gives a bound on
    what magnitude of gradients to include in the calculation. For
    example, threshold=.75 means ignore any gradients that are less
    than 75% of the maximum gradient in the image. The optional
    blursize parameter sets the size of a Gaussian filter that is
    applied to the image. This step improves accuracy when small
    features in the image have large gradients (e.g. dust particles
    on the camera). Without blurring, these features may be
    incorrectly identified as the hologram center. For best results,
    blursize should be set to the radius of features to be ignored,
    but smaller than the distance between hologram fringes. To skip
    blurring, set blursize to 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        image to find the center(s) in
    centers : int
        number of centers to find
    threshold : float (optional)
        fraction of the maximum gradient below which all

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        row(s) and column(s) of center(s)

    Notes
    -----
    When threshold is close to 1, the code will run quickly but may lack
    accuracy. When threshold is set to 0, the gradient at all pixels will
    contribute to finding the centers and the code will take a little
    bit longer.
