    """
    More convenient Fast Fourier Transform

    An easier to use fft function, it will pick the correct fft to do
    based on the shape of the Marray, and do the fftshift for you.  This
    is intended for working with images, and thus for dimensions
    greater than 2 does slicewise transforms of each "image" in a
    multidimensional stack

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
       The array to transform
    overwrite : bool
       Allow this function to overwrite the Marry you pass in.  This
       may improve performance slightly.  Default is not to overwrite
    shift : bool
       Whether to preform an fftshift on the Marry to give low
       frequences near the center as you probably expect.  Default is
       to do the fftshift.

    Returns
    -------
    fta : ndarray
       The fourier transform of `a`

    Parameters
    ----------

    Returns
    -------
    rot: array(3,3)
        Rotation matrix. To rotate a column vector x, use np.dot(rot, x.) 

    Notes
    -----
    The Euler angles rotate a vector (in the active picture) by alpha
    clockwise about the fixed lab z axis, beta clockwise about
    the lab y axis, and by gamma about the lab z axis.  Clockwise is
    defined as viewed from the origin, looking in the positive direction
    along an axis.  

    This breaks compatability with previous conventions, which were adopted for 
    compatability with the passive picture used by SCSMFO.
