"""Add simulated noise to images. Intended for use with exact
calculated images to make them look more like noisy 'real'
measurements.

    """Adds simulated noise to an image

    Real image noise usually has correlation, so we smooth the raw
    random variable. The noise_mean can be controlled independently of
    the poisson_lambda that controls the shape of the distribution. In
    general, you can stick with our default of a large poisson_lambda
    (ie for imaging conditions not near the shot noise limit).

    Defaults are set to give noise vaguely similar to what we tend to
    see in our holographic imaging.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray or Image
        The image to add noise to.
    intensity : float
        How large the noise mean should be relative to the image mean
    smoothing : float
        Fraction of the image size to smooth by. Should in general be << 1
    poisson_lambda : float
        Used to compute the shape of the noise distribution. You can generally
        leave this at its default value unless you are simulating shot noise
        limited imaging.

    Returns
    -------
    noisy_image : ndarray
       A copy of the input image with noise added.
