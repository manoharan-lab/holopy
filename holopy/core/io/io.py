        The object to save

    Notes
    -----
    Marray objects are actually saved as a custom yaml file consisting of a yaml
    header and a numpy .npy binary array.  This is done because yaml's saving of
    binary array is very slow for large arrays.  HoloPy can read these 'yaml'
    files, but any other yaml implementation will get confused.
