    ----------
    data : :class:`.Image` or :class:`.VectorGrid`
       Hologram to propagate
    d : float or list of floats
       Distance to propagate, in meters, or desired schema.  A list tells to

    Calculates the optical transfer function to use in reconstruction

    This routine uses the analytical form of the transfer function
    found in in Kreis [1]_.  It can optionally do cascaded free-space
    propagation for greater accuracy [2]_, although the code will run
    slightly more slowly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : (int, int)
       maximum dimensions of the transfer function
    spacing : (float, float)
       the spacing between points is the grid to calculate
    wavelen : float
       the wavelength in the medium you are propagating through
    d : float or list of floats
       reconstruction distance.  If list or array, this function will
       return an array of transfer functions, one for each distance
    cfsp : integer (optional)
       cascaded free-space propagation factor.  If this is an integer
       > 0, the transfer function G will be calculated at d/csf and
       the value returned will be G**csf.
    squeeze : Bool (optional)
       Remove length 1 dimensions (so that if only one distance is
       specified trans_func will be a 2d array)
    gradient_filter : float (optional)
       Subtract a second transfer function a distance gradient_filter
       from each z

    Returns
    -------
    trans_func : np.ndarray
       The calculated transfer function.  This will be at most as large as
       shape, but may be smaller if the frequencies outside that are zero
