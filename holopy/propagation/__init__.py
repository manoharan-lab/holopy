"""Numerical light propagation.

Computes light propagation from one known set of points to another set
using the convolution algorithm.

Propagation is used primarily for one operation:

1. :class:`.Image` or :class:`.VectorGrid` (Electric field) =->
   :class:`.Image`, :class:`.Volume` or :class:`.VectorGrid` at
   another position

holopy.propagate depends on holopy.core
