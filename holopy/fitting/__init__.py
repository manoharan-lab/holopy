"""Fit models of scattering to data

Make precision measurements of a scattering system by fitting a model
of it to data

The fitting module is used to:

1. Define Scattering Model -> :class:`~holopy.fitting.model.Model` object
2. Fit model to data -> :class:`.FitResult` object
3. Fit model to timeseries -> list of :class:`.FitResult` objects
