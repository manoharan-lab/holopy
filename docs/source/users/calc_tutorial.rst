Scattering Calculations
=======================

Optical physicists and astronomers have worked out how to compute the
scattering of light from many kinds of objects.  HoloPy provides an
easy interface for computing scattered fields, intensities, scattering
matrices, cross-sections, and holograms generated by microscopic objects.


A Simple Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start by calculating an in-line hologram generated by a
plane wave scattering from a microsphere.

.. plot:: pyplots/calc_sphere.py
   :include-source:


We'll examine each section of code in turn.  The first few lines :

..  testcode::
  
    import holopy as hp
    from holopy.scattering import calc_holo, Sphere

load the relevant modules from HoloPy that we'll need for doing our
calculation.  The next lines describes the scattering experiment we would like to simulate:

..  testcode::
    
    sphere = Sphere(n = 1.59, r = .5, center = (4, 4, 5))
    detector = hp.detector_grid(shape = 100, spacing = .1)
    medium_index = 1.33
    illum_wavelen = 0.660
    illum_polarization = (1,0)

We will be scattering light off a :class:`~holopy.scattering.scatterer` object, specifically a
:class:`.Sphere`. A :class:`~holopy.scattering.scatterer` object
contains information about the geometry (position, size, shape) and
optical properties (refractive index) of the object that is scattering
light.  We've defined a spherical scatterer with radius 0.5 microns,
center of mass at x=4, y=4, z=5 microns, and index of refraction
1.59. This refractive index is approximately that of polystyrene.
The scattered light will be collected at a detector, which is frequently a digital camera mounted onto a microscope. 
Our detector is defined as a 100 x 100 pixel array, with each square pixel of side length .1 microns.

After having defined our scatterer and our detector, we need to tell HoloPy something about our illumination setup.
We are going to be using red light (wavelength = 660 nm in vacuum) polarized in the x-direction to 
illuminate a scatterer immersed in water (refractive index = 1.33). Refer to 
:ref:`units` and :ref:`coordinate_system` if you're confused about how 
the wavelength and polarization are specified.

After getting everything ready, the actual scattering calculation is straightforward:

..  testcode::

    holo = calc_holo(detector, sphere, medium_index, illum_wavelen, illum_polarization)
    hp.show(holo)

Congratulations! You just calculated the in-line hologram
generated at the detector plane by interference between the
scattered field and the reference wave. For an in-line
hologram, the reference wave is simply the part of the field that is not scattered 
or absorbed by the particle.  

..  testcode::
    :hide:
    
    print(holo[0,0].values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:

    [ 1.01201782]

You might have noticed that our scattering calculation requires much of the same metadata we specified when loading an image.
If we have an experimental image from the sysetm we would like to model, we can use that as an argument
in :func:`.calc_holo` instead of our ``detector`` object created from :func:`.detector_grid`.
HoloPy will then use the experimental image's metadata to calculate a hologram image with the same dimensions. This
is particularly useful when comparing predicted holograms to measured data. 

..  testcode::
    
    from holopy.core.io import get_example_data_path
    from holopy.core.process import subimage
    imagepath = get_example_data_path('image01.jpg')
    exp_img = hp.load_image(imagepath, spacing=0.0851, medium_index=medium_index, illum_wavelen=illum_wavelen, illum_polarization=illum_polarization)
    exp_img = subimage(exp_img, [100,100],100)

..  testcode::
    :hide:
    
    print(exp_img.shape)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:
    
    (1, 100, 100)

..  note::
    The last line crops the image to a more manageable size, using the built-in HoloPy :func:`.subimage` function. For details on this and other built-in
    image-processing functions, refer to the :ref:`tools` page.

We can now pass our image directly to :func:`.calc_holo`, which no longer requires us to explicitly specify illumination information. 

..  testcode::

    holo = calc_holo(exp_img, sphere)

..  testcode::
    :hide:
    
    print(holo[0,0].values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:

    [ 1.58558629]

So far all of the images we have calculated are holograms, or the interference pattern that results
from the superposition of a scattered wave with a reference wave. Holopy can also be used to
examine scattered fields on their own. Simply replace :func:`.calc_holo` with :func:`.calc_field` to look 
at scattered electric fields (complex) or :func:`.calc_intensity` to look at field amplitudes, which
is the typical measurement in a light scattering experiment.

Coated Spheres
--------------

HoloPy can also calculate holograms from coated (or multilayered) spheres.
Constructing a coated sphere differs only in specifying a
list of refractive indices and radii corresponding to the layers 
(starting from the core and working outwards).

..  testcode::
    
    coated_sphere = Sphere(center=(2.5, 5, 5), n=(1.59, 1.42), r=(0.3, 0.6))
    holo = calc_holo(exp_img, coated_sphere)
    hp.show(holo)

..  testcode::
    :hide:

    print(holo[0,0,0].values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:

    1.1831629319255395
    
If you prefer thinking in terms of the thickness of subsequent layers, instead of their distance from the center,
you can use :func:`.LayeredSphere` to achieve the same result:

..testcode::
    
    from holopy.scattering import LayeredSphere
    coated_sphere = LayeredSphere(center=(2.5, 5, 5), n=(1.59, 1.42), t=(0.3, 0.3))

Collection of Spheres
---------------------

If we want to calculate a hologram from a collection of spheres, we must
first define the spheres individually, and then combine them into a 
:class:`.Spheres` object:

..  testcode::

    from holopy.scattering import Spheres
    s1 = Sphere(center=(5, 5, 5), n = 1.59, r = .5)
    s2 = Sphere(center=(4, 4, 5), n = 1.59, r = .5)
    collection = Spheres([s1, s2])
    holo = calc_holo(exp_img, collection)
    hp.show(holo)

..  testcode::
    :hide:

    print(holo[0,0].values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:

    [ 1.24037847]

.. plot:: pyplots/calc_two_spheres.py

Adding more spheres to the cluster is as simple as defining more
sphere objects and passing a longer list of spheres to the
:class:`.Spheres` constructor.

Customizing Scattering Calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the examples above will be sufficient for most purposes, there are a few additional options that are useful in certain scenarios.

Scattering Theories in HoloPy
-----------------------------

HoloPy contains a number of scattering theories to model the scattering 
from different kinds of scatterers. By default, scattering from single
spheres is calculated using Mie theory, which is the exact solution
to Maxwell's equations for the scattered field from a spherical
particle, originally derived by Gustav Mie and (independently) by
Ludvig Lorenz in the early 1900s. 

A scatterer composed of multiple spheres can exhibit multiple scattering 
and coupling of the near-fields of neighbouring particles. Mie theory doesn't include
these effects, so :class:`.Spheres` objects are by default calculated using the
SCSMFO package from `Daniel Mackowski <http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~dmckwski/>`_,
which gives the exact solution to Maxwell's equation for the scattering from an 
arbitrary arrangement of non-overlapping spheres. 

Sometimes you might want to calculate scattering from multiple spheres 
using Mie theory if you are worried about computation time or if you are
using multi-layered spheres (HoloPy's implementation of the multisphere theory
can't currently handle coated spheres). You can specify Mie theory manually when
calling the :func:`.calc_holo` function:

..  testcode::
    
    from holopy.scattering import Mie
    holo = calc_holo(exp_img, collection, theory = Mie)

..  testcode::
    :hide:
    
    print(holo[0,0,0].values)
    
..  testoutput::
    :hide:
    
    1.2474802764571784

Holopy can also access a discrete dipole approximation (DDA) theory to model arbitrary
non-spherical objects. See the :ref:`dda_tutorial` tutorial for more details.

Detector Types in HoloPy
------------------------

The :func:`.detector_grid` function we saw earlier creates holograms that display nicely and are easily compared to experimental images.
However, they can be computationally expensive, as they require calculations of the electric field at many points. If you only need to
calculate values at a few points, or if your points of interest are not arranged in a 2D grid, you can use :func:`.detector_points`,
which accepts either a dictionary of coordinates or indvidual coordinate dimensions:
    
..  testcode::
    
    x = [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]
    y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    z = -1
    coord_dict = {'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z}
    detector = hp.detector_points(x = x, y = y, z = z)
    detector = hp.detector_points(coord_dict)

..  testcode::
    :hide:
    
    print(detector[0].values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:
    
    0.0

The coordinates for :func:.`detector_points` can be specified in terms of either Cartesian or spherical coordinates. If spherical coordinates are used, the
the ``center`` value of your scatterer is ignored and the coordinates are interpreted as being relative to the scatterer.


Static light scattering calculations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scattering Matrices
-------------------
In a static light scattering measurement you record the scattered
intensity at a number of angles. In this kind of experiment you are
usually not interested in the exact distance of the detector from the
particles, and so it's most convenient to work with scattering matrices. 

..  testcode::

    import numpy as np
    from holopy.scattering import calc_scat_matrix
    
    detector = hp.detector_points(theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100), phi = 0)
    distant_sphere = Sphere(r=0.5, n=1.59)
    matr = calc_scat_matrix(detector, distant_sphere, medium_index, illum_wavelen)
    
..  testcode::
    :hide:
    
    print(matr[0,0,0].values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:

    (24.656950420047853-19.765527788603396j)

Here we omit specifying the location (center) of the scatterer. This is
only valid when you're calculating a far-field quantity. Similarly, note 
that our detector, defined from a :func:`.detector_points` function, 
includes information about direction but not distance. It is typical 
to look at scattering matrices on a semilog plot. You can make one as follows:
    
..  testcode::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure()
    plt.semilogy(np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100), abs(matr[:,0,0])**2)
    plt.semilogy(np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100), abs(matr[:,1,1])**2)
    plt.show()

.. plot:: pyplots/calc_scat_matr.py

Scattering Cross-Sections
-------------------------

The scattering cross section provides a measure of how much light from an incident 
beam is scattered by a particular scatterer. Similar to calculating scattering matrices,
we can omit the position of the scatterer for calculation of cross sections.
Since cross sections integrates over all angles, we can also omit the 
``detector`` argument entirely:

..  testcode::

    from holopy.scattering import calc_cross_sections
    x_sec = calc_cross_sections(distant_sphere, medium_index, illum_wavelen, illum_polarization)
    
..  testcode::
    :hide:

    print(x_sec.values)

..  testoutput::
    :hide:

    [ 1.93274289  0.          1.93274289  0.91619823]

x_sec returns an array containing four elements. The first element is the scattering cross section, specified in terms of the same
units as wavelength and particle size. The second and third elements are the absorption
and extinction cross sections, respectively. The final element is the average value of the cosine of the scattering angle.
