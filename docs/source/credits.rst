If you use HoloPy, we ask that you cite the articles above that are
relevant to your application.

For scattering calculations and formalism, we draw heavily on
the treatise of Bohren & Huffman.  We generally follow their conventions
except where noted.

The package includes code from several sources.  We thank Daniel
Mackowski for allowing us to include his T-Matrix code, which computes
scattering from clusters of spheres:  SCSMFO1B_.

We also make use of a modified version of the Python version of
mpfit_, originally developed by Craig Markwardt. The modified version
we use is drawn from the stsci_python_ package.

We thank A. Ross Barnett for permitting us to use his routine
SBESJY.FOR_, which computes spherical Bessel functions.
